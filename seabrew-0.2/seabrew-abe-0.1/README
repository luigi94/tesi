This software provides several tools implementing a scheme for
"ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption" (CP-ABE) with
SEA-BREW (Scalable Attribute-Based Encryption Revocable Scheme)
extensions that permit, as the name states, to revoke keys without
the need to edit the access policy (or attributes value).

To install this software, you will need to have libseabrew
library installed.
You can get it from the following pages:
