.SH SYNOPSIS
.B seabrew-abe-keygen
[\fIOPTION \fR...] \fIPUB_KEY MASTER_KEY ATTR \fR[\fIATTR \fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Generate a key with the listed attributes using public key PUB_KEY and
master secret key MASTER_KEY. Output will be written to the file
"priv_key" unless the \fB\-o\fR option is specified.
.PP
Additionally, set the generated key's version to the MASTER_KEY's version.
.PP
Attributes come in two forms: non\-numerical and numerical. Non\-numerical
attributes are simply any string of letters, digits, and underscores
beginning with a letter.
.PP
Numerical attributes are specified as `attr = N', where N is a non\-negative
integer less than 2^64 and `attr' is another string. The whitespace around
the `=' is optional. One may specify an explicit length of k bits for the
integer by giving `attr = N#k'. Note that any comparisons in a policy given
to seabrew-abe\-enc(1) must then specify the same number of bits, e.g.,
`attr > 5#12'.
.PP
The keywords `and', `or', and `of', are reserved for the policy language
of seabrew-abe\-enc (1) and may not be used for either type of attribute.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

.SH EXAMPLES

Generating a key for a new employee Sara:

  $ seabrew-abe-keygen -o sara_priv_key pub_key master_key \\
.br
      sysadmin it_department

Generating a key with more complicated attributes:

  $ seabrew-abe-keygen -o kevin_priv_key pub_key master_key \\
.br
      business_staff strategy_team 'executive_level = 7#4' \\
.br
      office=2362 'hire_date = '`date +%s`

Note the usage of date (1) as a convenient way of storing a time in a
numerical attribute.
