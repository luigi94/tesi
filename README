First, install libswabe running:
	./install_cpabe.sh
(it will install also basic cp-abe primitives)

Then move to libseabrew-01 and install it:
	cd libseabrew-01
	./configure
	make
	make install

Repeat the same operations to install seabrew-abe
primitives:
	cd seabrew-abe-01
	./configure
	make
	make install

To test seabrew-abe primitives launch
	./test.sh
in this folder.
The test script will generate public, master and decryption key
with some attributes and encrypt a PDF document.
Then it will update the key and the ciphertext and finally it
will decrypt the ciphertext. Edit this script to test different
sequences of revocation/key updates.
